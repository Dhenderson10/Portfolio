Achievements:

Trunk: When you click on contact and enter your name, the website thanks you
personally, and then displays your name after "Welcome" on the home
page

Submission: On the contact page, checks if you entered a valid
name, however, I understand that the implication of this
acheivment might have been to check 5 fields, and not just one in a 
5 field form.

Thank you
