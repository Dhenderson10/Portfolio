This program is a data visualization of World Happiness. The data comes from the World Happiness Report, a survey of the state of global happiness. Three data sets were used for this project, one from 2015, 2016 and 2017. Participants of the survey are asked many questions related to factors that would contribute to a country's happiness such as health, percieved freedom, GDP, etc. You can learn more about this survey at the website http://worldhappiness.report/. This data visualization was tested in Firefox and should work in the browser on both Mac and Windows. Simply right click index_final.html and open with Firefox to view. Click on a country to display it's happiness score in the bottom left and hover over the pie chart to view how the factors influenced the score. The visualiztion is also color coded; greener countries indicated happiness, while red countries indicated the opposite.
